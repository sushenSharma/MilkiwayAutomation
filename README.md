Milkiway Automation Project
This project is designed to automate mobile application testing using Appium with BrowserStack. It follows a structured approach to ensure ease of use and scalability. Below is an overview of the project's framework and its key components.

Framework Structure
AndroidDriverBuilder Class: This class is responsible for setting up and defining the capabilities required for the Appium driver. It includes configurations for BrowserStack integration, ensuring tests can be executed on various devices and OS versions hosted on BrowserStack's cloud platform.

BrowserStack Integration: The project utilizes BrowserStack for executing automation tests. This enables testing across a wide range of devices and environments without the need for a physical device lab.

Credentials Management: Access keys and credentials for BrowserStack are securely passed and managed within the AndroidDriverBuilder Class. This ensures secure access to BrowserStack services for test execution.

Page Object Model: The project adopts the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. A separate class is created for each screen within the application, and these classes are organized under the Pages folder. This approach enhances test maintenance and reduces code duplication.

Locators and Functions: Within each Page class, locators are defined as protected variables. Functions are provided to interact with these elements, promoting reusability and readability of the test scripts.

BasePage Class: This class serves as a foundation for all Page classes. It includes common utility functions such as waitInMilliseconds for explicit waits and hideKeyboard to manage the keyboard visibility during tests. This helps in reducing boilerplate code across Page classes.

Test Cases: Test cases are defined in classes extending from the BaseTest class. For example, the TestLogin class contains test cases related to login functionality, demonstrating the use of the framework and Page objects.
